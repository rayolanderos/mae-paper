        <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
        <p>With regard to postpartum depression (PPD) and other perinatal mood and anxiety disorders,
            many mothers would rather rely on self-help methodology rather than seeking professional help
            for a number of reasons including cultural stigma, expectations for happiness during new motherhood,
            and distrust of formal mental health services.<sup><a href="/mae-paper/related/index.html">10</a></sup>
            These barriers prevent women from identifying that
            they have PPD and receiving appropriate treatment as early as possible.</p>
        <p>Early detection is important when identifying and treating PPD. According to the Postpartum Depression:
            Action Towards Causes and Treatment (PACT) Consortium,

          <blockquote>“Clinical screening for depressive symptoms might occur only once in the postpartum period.
                A positive screen will be diagnosed as postpartum depression but will not delineate when symptoms
                began and the length of time for which they have been present. This lack of specificity could lead
                to diagnostic confusion and inadequate or ineffective treatment...Identification of whether the
                episode began before and continued into the pregnancy, during pregnancy, or in the postpartum
                period is, therefore, very important." - <a href="http://www.pactforthecure.com/about/">PPD ACT group information</a></blockquote>

        </p>
        <p>Traditional methods for screening for PPD rely on standard questionnaires<sup><a href="/mae-paper/related/index.html">5</a></sup> that new mothers often fill out with a primary care or even the new baby’s
            pediatrician during a routine well visit for herself or her child.
            In this context, a mother is less likely to self-identify as having any undesirable or challenging emotions or thoughts,
            as they are trying to focus on their own physical health or the health of their child.</p>
        <p>In addition to the risks of PPD, new mothers are also at risk for feeling
            isolated and unsupported in general<sup><a href="/mae-paper/related/index.html">2</a></sup>.
            They also have the desire to share a lot of what they are experiencing throughout the day with loved ones,
            but may not feel that they have time to share their experiences.</p>
